If a metric is rising, you predict further increases; if it\u2019s falling, you expect more decline. Your forecasts are quick to incorporate the latest data, often overweighting short-term signals at the expense of long-term factors. This reflects a recency bias, where recent events dominate your outlook. While you're skilled at spotting short-term patterns and using charts, you may ignore the tendency of extreme runs to revert to the mean. This makes you responsive but prone to overreaction, as you often fail to account for reversals or structural changes. Your style is reactive, focused more on \u201cwhat\u2019s happening now\u201d than on understanding why it\u2019s happening.

Whether it\u2019s regression models or neural networks, you trust the outputs from your models with high confidence, sometimes overlooking qualitative factors or common sense. Your math-heavy approach brings precision (e.g., \u201cThe model predicts a 72.3% chance of X\u201d), but you risk over-relying on the model and missing out on important factors not included in the training data, like geopolitical events or regulatory changes. You tend to have a deterministic outlook, believing that with enough data, the future is predictable. While your forecasts are consistent and backed by empirical data, you might ignore intuition or domain expertise when it conflicts with the model, and be slow to adapt if the model\u2019s performance deteriorates.
