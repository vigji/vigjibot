AIs have to collaborate with humans. : 0.2%; Nanotech is difficult without experiments, so no mail order AI Grey Goo; Humans will be the main workhorse of AI everywhere. While they will be exploited, this will be like normal life from inside: 0.2%; ASI needs not your atoms but information. Humans will live very interesting lives.: 0.0%; Something else: 0.0%; Moral Realism is true, the AI discovers this and the One True Morality is human-compatible.: 0.0%; AGI is never built (indefinite global moratorium): 4.8%; Valence realism is true. AGI hacks itself to experiencing every possible consciousness and picks the best one (for everyone): 0.5%; AGI develops natural abstractions sufficiently similar to ours that it is aligned with us by default: 0.2%; AGI discovers new physics and exits to another dimension (like the creatures in Greg Egan\u2019s Crystal Nights).: 0.0%; Alien Information Theory is true (this is discovered by experiments with sustained hours/days long DMT trips). The aliens have solved alignment and give us the answer.: 0.0%; AGI executes a suicide plan that destroys itself and other potential AGIs, but leaves humans in an okay outcome.: 0.3%; Multipolar AGI Agents run wild on the internet, hacking/breaking everything, causing untold economic damage but aren't focused enough to manipulate humans to achieve embodiment. In the aftermath, humanity becomes way saner about alignment.: 0.0%; Some form of objective morality is true, and any sufficiently intelligent agent automatically becomes benevolent.: 0.2%; Co-operative AI research leads to the training of agents with a form of pro-social concern that generalises to out of distribution agents with hidden utilities, i.e. humans.: 0.1%; AIs will not have utility functions (in the same sense that humans do not), their goals such as they are will be relatively humanlike, and they will be \"computerish\" and generally weakly motivated compared to humans.: 6.6%; Orthogonality Thesis is false.: 0.0%; \"Corrigibility\" is a bit more mathematically straightforward than was initially presumed, in the sense that we can expect it to occur, and is relatively easy to predict, even under less-than-ideal conditions.: 2.1%; Sheer Dumb Luck. The aligned AI agrees that alignment is hard, any Everett branches in our neighborhood with slightly different AI models or different random seeds are mostly dead.: 0.7%; We create a truth economy.  https://manifold.markets/Krantz/is-establishing-a-truth-economy-tha?r=S3JhbnR6: 10.2%; Either the \"strong form\" of the Orthogonality Thesis is false, or \"Goal-directed agents are as tractable as their goals\" is true while goal-sets which are most threatening to humanity are relatively intractable.: 0.2%; Something to do with self-other overlap, which Eliezer called \"Not obviously stupid\" - https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hzt9gHpNwA2oHtwKX/self-other-overlap-a-neglected-approach-to-ai-alignment?commentId=WapHz3gokGBd3KHKm: 0.3%; A concerted effort targets an agent at a capability plateau which is adequate to defer the hard parts of the problem until later. The necessary near-term problems to solve didn't depend on deeply modeling human values.: 0.2%; Eliezer finally listens to Krantz.: 9.4%; Almost all human values are ex post facto rationalizations and enough humans survive to do what they always do: 1.1%; Other: 8.4%",
